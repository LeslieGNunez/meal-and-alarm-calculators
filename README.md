# meal-and-alarm-calculators
A beginner-friendly Python project that includes two simple calculators: one to compute a restaurant bill including tip and tax, and another to determine the time an alarm will go off based on a 24-hour clock.

# Tip, Tax, and Alarm Clock Calculators

This project includes two beginner-level Python programs that demonstrate basic programming logic, user input, and arithmetic operations.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: Dinner Outing Total Calculator
This script prompts the user to input a total food charge, then calculates:
- An 18% tip
- A 7% sales tax
- The total amount owed

The program outputs all the values with proper formatting.

### Part 2: 24-Hour Alarm Clock Calculator
This script asks the user:
- What time it is currently (in 24-hour format)
- How many hours until they want the alarm to go off

It then calculates and displays the time the alarm will go off using modulo arithmetic.
